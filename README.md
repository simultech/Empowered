Empowered
=======
Empowered is an open source and free to use social network which leverages Australian open data to provide information to, and about carers.  The application is based on the CakePHP framework and works on a standard LAMP stack.  

Empowered is a web application dedicated to increase awareness — about, and for the carers of disabled members of the community.  Empowered aims to make the Australian community aware of the lives of carers in their community, and just as importantly, we want to put relevant government information into the hands of the carers.  With the creation of the NDIS, we feel that it’s a perfect time to create better social networks to support carers and the disabled.
